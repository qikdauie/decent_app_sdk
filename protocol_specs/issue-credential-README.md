## Change Log

- 20240320: Clarification removing references to retired `~please_ack` decorator and RFC.
- 20240313: Version 2.0 is the current version
- 20240311: Removed references to payments in the protocol to clarify to those new to the protocol that they have not been implemented by anyone.

For a period of time, versions 2.1 and 2.2 where defined in this RFC. Those
definitions were added prior to any implementations, and to date, there are no
known implementations available or planned. An attempt at [implementing version 2.1]
was not merged into the main branch of [Aries Cloud Agent Python], deemed
overly complicated and not worth the effort for what amounts to an edge case
(issuing multiple credentials of the same type in a single protocol instance).
Further, there is a [version 3.0] of this protocol that has been specified and implemented that
does not include these capabilities. Thus, a decision was made that versions 2.1 and 2.2 be removed
as being not accepted by the community and overly complicated to both implement
and migrate from. Those interested in seeing how those capabilities were
specified can look at this [protocol before they were removed].

[version 3.0]: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/waci-didcomm/tree/main/issue_credential

### 2.0/propose-credential and identifiers

Version 2.0 of the protocol is introduced because of a breaking changes in the propose-credential message, replacing the (indy-specific) filtration criteria with a generalized filter attachment to align with the rest of the messages in the protocol. The previous version is [1.1/propose-credential](../0036-issue-credential/README.md).
Version 2.0 also uses &lt;angle brackets&gt; explicitly to mark all values that may vary between instances, such as identifiers and comments.

The "formats" field is added to all the messages to enable the linking the specific attachment IDs with the the format (credential format and version) of the attachment.

The details that are part of each message type about the different attachment formats serves as a registry of the known formats and versions.

## Summary

Formalizes messages used to issue a credential--whether the credential is JWT-oriented, JSON-LD-oriented, or ZKP-oriented. The general flow is similar, and this protocol intends to handle all of them. If you are using a credential type that doesn't fit this protocol, please [raise a Github issue](/github-issues.md).

## Motivation

We need a standard protocol for issuing credentials. This is the basis of interoperability between Issuers and Holders.

## Tutorial

### Name and Version

`issue-credential`, version 2.0

### Roles

There are two roles in this protocol: Issuer and Holder. Technically, the latter role is only potential until the protocol completes; that is, the second party becomes a Holder of a credential by completing the protocol. However, we will use the term Holder throughout, to keep things simple.

>Note: When a holder of credentials turns around and uses those credentials to prove something, they become a Prover. In the sister RFC to this one, [0454: Present Proof Protocol 2.0](../0454-present-proof-v2/README.md), the Holder is therefore renamed to Prover. Sometimes in casual conversation, the Holder role here might be called "Prover" as well, but more formally, "Holder" is the right term at this phase of the credential lifecycle.

### Goals

When the goals of each role are not available because of context, goal codes may be specifically included in protocol messages. This is particularly helpful to differentiate between credentials passed between the same parties for several different reasons. A goal code included should be considered to apply to the entire thread and is not necessary to be repeated on each message. Changing the goal code may be done by including the new code in a message. All goal codes are optional, and without default.

### States

The choreography diagram [below](#choreography-diagram) details how state evolves in this protocol, in a "happy path." The states include

#### Issuer States

- proposal-received
- offer-sent
- request-received
- credential-issued
- done

#### Holder States

- proposal-sent
- offer-received
- request-sent
- credential-received
- done

Errors might occur in various places. For example, an Issuer might offer a credential for a price that the Holder is unwilling to pay. All errors are modeled with a `problem-report` message. Easy-to-anticipate errors reset the flow as shown in the diagrams, and use the code `issuance-abandoned`; more exotic errors (e.g., server crashed at Issuer headquarters in the middle of a workflow) may have different codes but still cause the flow to be abandoned in the same way. That is, in this version of the protocol, all errors cause the state of both parties (the sender and the receiver of the `problem-report`) to revert to `null` (meaning it is no longer engaged in the protocol at all). Future versions of the protocol may allow more granular choices (e.g., requesting and receiving a (re-)send of the `issue-credential` message if the Holder times out while waiting in the `request-sent` state).

The state table outlines the protocol states and transitions.

### Messages

The Issue Credential protocol consists of these messages:

- `propose-credential` - potential Holder to Issuer (optional). Tells what the Holder hopes to receive.
- `offer-credential` - Issuer to potential Holder (optional for some credential implementations; required for Hyperledger Indy). Tells what the Issuer intends to issue, and possibly, the price the Issuer expects to be paid.
- `request-credential` - potential Holder to Issuer. If neither of the previous message types is used, this is the message that begins the protocol.
- `issue-credential` - Issuer to new Holder. Attachment payload contains the actual credential.

In addition, the [`ack`](../0015-acks/README.md) and [`problem-report`](../0035-report-problem/README.md) messages are adopted into the protocol for confirmation and error handling.

#### Message Attachments

This protocol is about the messages that must be exchanged to issue verifiable credentials, NOT about the specifics of particular verifiable credential schemes. [DIDComm attachments](../../concepts/0017-attachments/README.md) are deliberately used in messages to isolate the protocol flow/semantics from the credential artifacts themselves as separate constructs. Attachments allow credential formats and this protocol to evolve through versioning milestones independently instead of in lockstep. Links are provided in the message descriptions below, to describe how the protocol adapts to specific verifiable credential implementations.

The attachment items in the messages are arrays. The arrays are provided to support the issuing of different credential formats (e.g. ZKP, JSON-LD JWT, or other) containing the same data (claims). The arrays are not to be used for issuing credentials with different claims. The `formats` field of each message associates each attachment with the format (and version) of the attachment.

A registry of attachment formats is provided in this RFC within the message type sections. A sub-section should be added for each attachment format type (and optionally, each version). Updates to the attachment type formats does **NOT** impact the versioning of the Issue Credential protocol. Formats are flexibly defined. For example, the first definitions are for `hlindy/cred-abstract@v2.0` et al., assuming that all Hyperledger Indy implementations and ledgers will use a common format. However, if a specific instance of Indy uses a different format, another format value can be documented as a new registry entry.

Any of the [0017-attachments RFC](../../concepts/0017-attachments/README.md#json) embedded inline attachments can be used. In the examples below, `base64` is used in most cases, but implementations MUST expect any of the formats.

The protocol has 3 alternative beginnings:

1. The Issuer can begin with an offer.
2. The Holder can begin with a proposal.
3. the Holder can begin with a request.

The offer and proposal messages are part of an optional negotiation phase and may trigger back-and-forth counters. A request is not subject to negotiation; it can only be accepted or rejected.

#### Propose Credential

An optional message sent by the potential Holder to the Issuer to initiate the protocol or in response to an `offer-credential` message when the Holder wants some adjustments made to the credential data offered by Issuer.

<blockquote>
Note: In Hyperledger Indy, where the `request-credential` message can **only** be sent in response to an `offer-credential` message, the `propose-credential` message is the only way for a potential Holder to initiate the workflow.
</blockquote>

Message format:

```json
{
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/%VER/propose-credential",
    "@id": "<uuid of propose-message>",
    "goal_code": "<goal-code>",
    "comment": "<some comment>",
    "credential_preview": <json-ld object>,
    "formats" : [
        {
            "attach_id" : "<attach@id value>",
            "format" : "<format-and-version>"
        }
    ],
    "filters~attach": [
        {
            "@id": "<attachment identifier>",
            "mime-type": "application/json",
            "data": {
                "base64": "<bytes for base64>"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Description of attributes:

- `goal_code` -- optional field that indicates the goal of the message sender.
- `comment` -- an optional field that provides human readable information about this Credential Proposal, so the proposal can be evaluated by human judgment. Follows [DIDComm conventions for l10n](../0043-l10n/README.md).
- `credential_preview` -- an optional JSON-LD object that represents the credential data that Prover wants to receive. It matches the schema of [Credential Preview](#preview-credential).
- `formats` -- contains an entry for each `filters~attach` array entry, providing the the value of the attachment `@id` and the verifiable credential format and version of the attachment. Accepted values for the `format` items are provided in the per format "Attachment" sections immediately below.
- `filters~attach` -- an array of attachments that further define the credential being proposed. This might be used to clarify which formats or format versions are wanted.

#### Offer Credential

A message sent by the Issuer to the potential Holder, describing the credential they intend to offer and possibly the price they expect to be paid. In Hyperledger Indy, this message is required, because it forces the Issuer to make a cryptographic commitment to the set of fields in the final credential and thus prevents Issuers from inserting spurious data. In credential implementations where this message is optional, an Issuer can use the message to negotiate the issuing following receipt of a `request-credential` message.

Message Format:

```json
{
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/%VER/offer-credential",
    "@id": "<uuid of offer message>",
    "goal_code": "<goal-code>",
    "replacement_id": "<issuer unique id>",
    "comment": "<some comment>",
    "credential_preview": <json-ld object>,
    "formats" : [
        {
            "attach_id" : "<attach@id value>",
            "format" : "<format-and-version>",
        }
    ],
    "offers~attach": [
        {
            "@id": "<attach@id value>",
            "mime-type": "application/json",
            "data": {
                "base64": "<bytes for base64>"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Description of fields:

- `goal_code` -- optional field that indicates the goal of the message sender.
- `replacement_id` -- an optional field to help coordinate credential replacement. When this is present and matches the `replacement_id` of a previously issued credential, it may be used to inform the recipient that the offered credential is considered to be a replacement to the previous credential. This value is unique to the issuer. It must not be used in a credential presentation.
- `comment` -- an optional field that provides human readable information about this Credential Offer, so the offer can be evaluated by human judgment. Follows [DIDComm conventions for l10n](../0043-l10n/README.md).
- `credential_preview` -- a JSON-LD object that represents the credential data that Issuer is willing to issue. It matches the schema of [Credential Preview](#preview-credential);
- `formats` -- contains an entry for each `offers~attach` array entry, providing the the value of the attachment `@id` and the verifiable credential format and version of the attachment. Accepted values for the `format` items are provided in the per format "Attachment" sections immediately below.
- `offers~attach` -- an array of attachments that further define the credential being offered. This might be used to clarify which formats or format versions will be issued.

It is possible for an Issuer to add a [`~timing.expires_time` decorator](../0032-message-timing/README.md#tutorial) to this message to convey the idea that the offer will expire at a particular point in the future. Such behavior is not a special part of this protocol, and support for it is not a requirement of conforming implementations; the `~timing` decorator is simply a general possibility for any DIDComm message. We mention it here just to note that the protocol can be enriched in composable ways.

#### Request Credential

This is a message sent by the potential Holder to the Issuer, to request the issuance of a credential. Where circumstances do not require a preceding Offer Credential message (e.g., there is no cost to issuance that the Issuer needs to explain in advance, and there is no need for cryptographic negotiation), this message initiates the protocol. When using the Hyperledger Indy AnonCreds verifiable credential format, this message can only be sent in response to an `offer-credential` message.

Message Format:

```json
{
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/%VER/request-credential",
    "@id": "<uuid of request message>",
    "goal_code": "<goal-code>",
    "comment": "<some comment>",
    "formats" : [
        {
            "attach_id" : "<attach@id value>",
            "format" : "<format-and-version>",
        }
    ],
    "requests~attach": [
        {
            "@id": "<attachment identifier>",
            "mime-type": "application/json",
            "data": {
                "base64": "<bytes for base64>"
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

Description of Fields:

- `goal_code` -- optional field that indicates the goal of the message sender.
- `comment` -- an optional field that provides human readable information about this Credential Request, so it can be evaluated by human judgment. Follows [DIDComm conventions for l10n](../0043-l10n/README.md).
- `formats` -- contains an entry for each `requests~attach` array entry, providing the the value of the attachment `@id` and the verifiable credential format and version of the attachment. Accepted values for the `format` items are provided in the per format "Attachment" sections immediately below.
- `requests~attach` -- an array of [attachments](../../concepts/0017-attachments/README.md) defining the requested formats for the credential.

#### Issue Credential

This message contains a verifiable credential being issued as an [attached payload](../../concepts/0017-attachments/README.md). It is sent in response to a valid Request Credential message.

Message Format:

```json
{
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/%VER/issue-credential",
    "@id": "<uuid of issue message>",
    "goal_code": "<goal-code>",
    "replacement_id": "<issuer unique id>",

                "base64": "<bytes for base64>"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Description of fields:

- `replacement_id` -- an optional field that provides an identifier used to manage credential replacement. When this value is present and matches the `replacement_id` of a previously issued credential, this credential may be considered as a replacement for that credential. This value is unique to the issuer. It must not be used in a credential presentation.
- `comment` -- an optional field that provides human readable information about the issued credential, so it can be evaluated by human judgment. Follows [DIDComm conventions for l10n](../0043-l10n/README.md).
- `formats` -- contains an entry for each `credentials~attach` array entry, providing the the value of the attachment `@id` and the verifiable credential format and version of the attachment. Accepted values for the `format` items are provided in the per format "Attachment" sections immediately below.
- `credentials~attach` -- an array of attachments containing the issued credentials.

W3C VC - Data Integrity Proof Credential | `didcomm/w3c-di-vc@v0.1` | [`Credential` format](../0809-w3c-data-integrity-credential-attachment/README.md#credential-attachment-format)|

#### Adopted Problem Report

The [problem-report message is adopted](../0035-report-problem/README.md) by this protocol. `problem-report` messages can be used by either party to indicate an error in the protocol.

#### Preview Credential

This is not a message but an inner object for other messages in this protocol. It is used construct a preview of the data for the credential that is to be issued. Its schema follows:

```jsonc
{
    "@type": "https://didcomm.org/issue-credential/%VER/credential-preview",
    "attributes": [
        {
            "name": "<attribute name>",
            "mime-type": "<type>",
            "value": "<value>"
        },
        // more attributes
    ]
}
```

The main element is `attributes`. It is an array of (object) attribute specifications; the subsections below outline their semantics.

##### Attribute Name

The mandatory `"name"` key maps to the attribute name as a string.

##### MIME Type and Value

The optional `mime-type` advises the issuer how to render a binary attribute, to judge its content for applicability before issuing a credential containing it. Its value parses case-insensitively in keeping with MIME type semantics of [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045). If `mime-type` is missing, its value is null.

The mandatory `value` holds the attribute value:

- if `mime-type` is missing (null), then `value` is a string. In other words, implementations interpret it the same as any other key+value pair in JSON
- if `mime-type` is not null, then `value` is always a base64url-encoded string that represents a binary BLOB, and `mime-type` tells how to interpret the BLOB after base64url-decoding.

## Threading

Threading can be used to initiate a [sub-protocol](../../concepts/0003-protocols/README.md#composable) during an issue credential protocol instance. For example, during credential issuance, the Issuer may initiate a child message thread to execute the `Present Proof` sub-protocol to have the potential Holder (now acting as a Prover) prove attributes about themselves before issuing the credential. Depending on circumstances, this might be a best practice for preventing credential fraud at issuance time.

If threading were added to all of the above messages, a `~thread` decorator would be present, and later messages in the flow would reference the `@id` of earlier messages to stitch the flow into a single coherent sequence. Details about threading can be found in the [0008: Message ID and Threading](../../concepts/0008-message-id-and-threading/README.md) RFC.

### Limitations

Smart contracts may be missed in ecosystem, so operation "issue credential after payment received" is not atomic. It’s possible case that malicious issuer will charge first and then will not issue credential in fact. But this situation should be easily detected and appropriate penalty should be applied in such type of networks.

### Negotiation and Preview

Negotiation prior to issuing the credential can be done using the `offer-credential` and `propose-credential` messages. A common negotiation use case would be about the data to go into the credential. For that, the `credential_preview` element is used.

## Drawbacks

None documented

## Rationale and alternatives

- Attention should be paid by the Aries community to other credential issuance protocols being proposed/used in other communities to ensure this RFC could support those protocols.
- Digital Bazaar has proposed the [Credential Handler API (CHAPI)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/) protocol that is being considered by the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/).

## Prior art

See [RFC 0036 Issue Credential, v1.x](../0036-issue-credential/README.md).

## Unresolved questions

- We might need to propose a new MIME type for credential (the same way as .docx is not processed as generic xml). See [this issue](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/421) against the W3C/vc-data-model.

## Implementations

The following lists the implementations (if any) of this RFC. Please do a pull request to add your implementation. If the implementation is open source, include a link to the repo or to the implementation within the repo. Please be consistent in the "Name" field so that a mechanical processing of the RFCs can generate a list of all RFCs supported by an Aries implementation.
